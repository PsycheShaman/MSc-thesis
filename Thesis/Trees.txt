#The Tree Object:

The TTree Class was specifically designed to optimize storage (i.e. in a more compressed format, and allowing faster access) of a large amount of objects of the same class.

root [0] TFile f("AliESDs.root");
root [1] TTree *esdTree = (TTree*)f.Get("esdTree");
root [2] new TBrowser
(TBrowser *) 0x8b949d0
root [3] (TFile *) 0x20fede0

//Number of Entries:

root [8] int n_event = tracks->GetEntries()
(int) 1147
root [9] n_event
(int) 1147
